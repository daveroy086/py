How to add a folder in my local repo
	go into the repo right click> new > folder and give it a name
	BUT, git status doesn't see it and you can't push an empty folder to github
	It has to contain a file
	Once it contains a file  
	git add .
	git commit
	git push and now the github repo has the folder and file
